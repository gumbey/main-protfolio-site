      <h2 class="kilo tblue push-none">Project brief</h2>
      <p class="p-width">For this project the client came to me with a good set of
      instructions to what he wanted, He was looking for something
      related to triangles, bright colours, and had to me a M for
      his first name Michael.</p>

      <h2 class="kilo tblue push-none">Research</h2>
      <p class="p-width">For this project I researched other gaming team logos and
      other simple logos done for entertainment groups. I started to look
      more into the name of the group. Entropy is a term used for the collection
      of random data that is generated from user inputs, For example the movement
      of a pointer on a computer is collected as entropy data and logged deep into
      the system. Entropy also is used in math equations and is represented by a triangle.</p>

      <h2 class="kilo tblue push-none gutter-1-2">First round sketches</h2>
      <p class="gutter-1-2">I wanted to focus on the triangle to represent
      the E for the logo and work in the other letters around it. After
      showing a couple people the logo it was clear the triangle wasnâ€™t
      doing the logo justice and ended up making it look like it was an A.</p>

      <p class="gutter-1-2">After looking back on everything I decided it
       would be best to just stay simple and straightforward.</p>
