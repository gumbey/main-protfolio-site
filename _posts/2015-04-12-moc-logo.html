      <p class="">For this project the client came to me with a good set of
instructions to what he wanted. He was looking for something
related to triangles, bright colors, and had to be an 'M' for
his first name Michael.</p>

      <p class="gutter-1-2">For this logo I started to look at how I could take an 'M' and
place it within a triangle, or how I could make the 'M' be made out
of triangles.</p>

      that was using the Infinite Triangle. I tried to combine it with an 'M'.
