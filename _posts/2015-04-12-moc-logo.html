      <p>For this project the client came to me with a good set of
      instructions to what he wanted, He was looking for something
      related to triangles, bright colours, and had to me a M for
      his first name Michael.</p>

      <h2 class="kilo tblue push-none">First round sketches</h2>
      <p>For this logo I started to look at how I could take a M and
      place it with in a triangle or how I could make it be made out
      of them.</p>

      <p>I picked the three best logos out of all the sketches that
      I had done. I went on to show him he saw what I was trying to
      do but didnâ€™t like any of the options I showed him.</p>
