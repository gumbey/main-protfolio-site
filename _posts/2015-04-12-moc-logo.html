      <p class="">For this project the client came to me with a good set of
      instructions to what he wanted, He was looking for something
      related to triangles, bright colours, and had to me a M for
      his first name Michael.</p>

      <p class="gutter-1-2">For this logo I started to look at how I could take a M and
      place it with in a triangle or how I could make it be made out
      of them.</p>

      <p class="gutter-1-2">I had one last Idea that
       I was doodling around with that was using the Infinite Triangle and
       combining it with a M. He gave me 10 minutes, and out came the final
       logo.</p>
