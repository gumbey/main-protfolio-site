      <p class="gutter push-0">Being a Graphic Designer is more then a job for me.
            It's been my goal since I was a little kid. I'm not in this
            for the money, but it is a nice bonus. As a designer
            my goal so to make you and your brand a success, because
            at the end of the day that's all that matters. The success of you
            in return drives the success of me.</p>
            <p class="gutter pad-t-1-2">Deep down I just want to be creative and make things,
            I tackle anything from a logo, to a box, to a 30 minute film and even some web design.
            I want to be as creative as I'm able to, I want to take that and focus it threw your brand and
            your image. You are the theme that I want to bring to life.</p>
