# Why am I a Graphic Designer

Being a Graphic Designer is more then a job for me. It's been my goal since I was a little kid. I'm not in this
for the money, but it is a nice bonus. As a designer my goal so to make you and your brand a success, because
at the end of the day that's all that matters. The success of you in return drives the success of me.
Deep down I just want to be creative and make things, I tackle anything from a logo, to a box, to a 30 minute film and even some web design.
I want to be as creative as I'm able to, I want to take that and focus it threw your brand and your image.You are the theme that I want to bring to life.
